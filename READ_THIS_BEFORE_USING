TODO when coding new stuff:
* define proply API's (with right params) so neural_net module will understand how to call it
* Comment each 'interesting' method and each step
* update run_example to let others know how to use the API's:
* keep use of Asserts in main code areas - this will help us debug later on
* keep write new methods/stuff in it's place so we can have module/nice code - would help in future
* edit TODO list after you finish working
--------------------------------
* DESIGN INFO:

* Simple design so far:
- 2x Modules - data_parser, neural_net
- Neural net class will connect the API given by data_parser (read below)
- All data will be (int) type -- meaning 24.5123 will be 24, etc. think if this what we want
-------------------------------
* VECTORS INFO :

- VECTORS will use ratings on scale of [1, 100] (Dribbling, Agility etc), if scale is not on that
    we need to update data to be in that scaling (for later algorithm use)
- Player vector is done as defined in constant
- Club vector now is just simple mean() operation on all players from that club, we will need to enhance it
-------------------------------
* Other info:

- preprocess method cleans/edits/removes data - please update it

-------------------------------

* Given API's to Neural Net module:
    # run_example to see how to use those API's:

    1. get_player_simple_vector(df, player)
    2. get_player_complex_vector(df, player)
    3. get_simple_club_vector(df, club)
    4. get_complex_club_vector(df, club)

TODO (by priority - first- most important):
0. make player simple vector int
1. enhance simple club vector (it's small now)
2. get more data for clubs complex vector
3. implement player complex vector AFTER neural net module?
4. implement methods with to do in them methods

TODO to think of:
1. Goalkeepers have different attributes (see CSV) how we work with them?
2. if we want to have 3x MODULES (defenders, midfilders, attackers) need to make special methods
to get all those (get_defenders(df, club), get_mid(df, club)... this easy cause we have col's)
