--------------------------------

TODO (by priority - first- most important):
0. add weights to compute distance (artiyum)
2. Clean the data, normalize the data, make use of additional columns which we didn't use until now, dummy variables.
3. Find to do something more interesting, for example find players that are the most unique, players that are more far
 away from other players (players that stand out) and think of a way to visualize this (make a plot, clustering?).
4. do more -- get players which are really 'different' -- very far away from players CLUSTERING??
5. ASsociation rules to expand?
6. similarity of goalkeepers (need to finish)

TODO not sure ?? i put all normalized/moduled data by Omer in last phases of constants
