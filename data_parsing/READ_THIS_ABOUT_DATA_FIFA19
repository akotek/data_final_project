* Edits being done on data:

1. Removed photos/col's which are not data related
2. Removed LS/ST/RS/LW/LF...etc DATA COLS - those col's are given the GRADE of a player in those fields
like: if i'm MESSI - I will be better in my original position (LW for example) and will get lower score in position
RS (right striker) or ML (midifielder left) - i removed this cause it seems it's too much data.
we can restore it if wanted.
3. Added column about time_of_player_in_team == which is just how much time he is in team == NOW()-start_contract


* INFO about cols:
1. ratings on scale of 100 (Dribbling, Agility etc)
2. International rep / week foot/ skill moves - rating on scale of 5
